{"response": "The term \"Muganda\" refers to someone from or associated with the Ganda people, who primarily inhabit parts of Uganda, particularly in the central region around Kampala.

{"response": "The term \"Muganda\" refers to someone from or associated with the Buganda Kingdom, which is located in what is now Uganda.
